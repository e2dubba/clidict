# Command Line Utility to Look up Foreign Words

The general operation of this tool is to create a sym link to the
`dictionary.py` file with one of the ISO language codes that is supported by
[glosbe.com][http://glosbe.com/a-api].

An additional feature will hope to add the word after it is found to an Anki
deck.
